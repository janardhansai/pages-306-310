<p>Causal forecasting methods are used for medium to long-term range planning
of aggregate production inventory, sales by product classes, or countrywide
sales by industrial sectors. Causal forecasting methods using econometric
models or simulation models are recommended for long-term forecasting,
because of the cost involved and difficulty of working with them.</p>
<p>Two areas that are particularly related to forecasting are those of budgeting and
planning. It is important how forecasting procedures can be integrated with at
least these two existing functions to be aware of the tactical and strategic  importance of forecasting procedures.</p>

Forecasting Methods</h2>
            
            <p> To illustrate the basic caution to be observed in the use of a time-series forecasting package, let us consider past data of the demand for two products.Product A presented an increasing and almost linear past demand, while pastdemand for product B presented an irregular shape, as shown by following tables and figures.</p>
            
            <p>Three different forecasting methods will be used:</p>

Knowledge Using Business Intelligence<br>
               (BI) and Data Mining Techniques</h2>
                  </center>
            
            <p>Another attitude known as exploration seeks to discover new occurrences or
innovative actions for the organization, searching the organization’s past
database. This process involves experiments in the search for new or hidden
information inside the database. It can lead to inconsistent results, but occasionally leads to new courses and important discoveries. Statistical techniques
such as regression and correlation analysis have been traditionally used to
                explore new facts or trends.</p>
            
<p>Business Intelligence (BI), also known as KDD (Knowledge Data Discovery),
technology is applied to suitably related information from different databases
to discover new facts, new relationships, or previously unknown trends. Data</p>
        </div>
            <br>
            <div class="paragraph">
           <p> mining techniques are used to seek out and discover new relationships and
               tendencies (Fayyad et al., 1996; Mena, 1999).</p>
<p>While a DSS is a mean to refine the existing information and data searching for
refined or optimized results, a BI or KDD is a technology used to explore the
data files searching for new knowledge (new information or new relationships
            hidden inside the database).</p>
            
           <p> This new type of tool to support decision making is developed due to two main
reasons: the pressure to increase the company’s competitiveness and the desire
to take advantage of the investments already made in information technology.
The search for these objectives is made by organizing data warehouses, which
are new data deposits, suitably joined with the existing database to explore the
               benefits offered by Data Mining technology.</p>
<p>The procedures for transforming existing data into new information which
makes it possible to form a new step of decision making are illustrated in Figures
    12.6.</p>
<p>Some terms and definitions used in a BI environment according to IBM (1999),
    Witten and Frank (2000), and Mena (1999) are:</p>
            
            <h3>Business Intelligence</h3>
            
           <p style="font-style: italic;">provides a route to obtain new knowledge needed to make important decision in the organization.</p>
            
            <h3>Datawarehouse</h3>
            
         <p style="font-style: italic;" >is a collection of integrated, dynamic, nonvolatile subject-oriented
